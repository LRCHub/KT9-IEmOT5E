You're gonna love this

You can't touch this

Cause I'm a bad bitch

We hit the elevator right up to the rooftop

The bass is pumping
Make me wanna screw the top off

Yeah, we'll be drinking, ain't nobody gonna stop us

And we'll be kissing everyone that's around us

I just wanna have fun tonight
Pull me out of the flashing light

Let me blow up this house tonigh

(Gon' blow up)

(BLOW)

We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want

Na Na Na Na

We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want

Bitch I'm Madonna
Bitch I'm Madonna
Bitch I'm Madonna

We're jumping in the pool
And swimming with our clothes on

I poured a beer into my shoe and got my freak on

The neighbors pissed and says hes gonna call the Five-O

If they show up then we gonna give a good show

I just wanna go up tonight
Pull me out of the flashing light

Let me blow up this house tonight

(Gon' blow up)

(BLOW)

Uhh, beep-beep, bitch move
We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want

Na Na Na Na

We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want

Bitch I'm Madonna
Bitch I'm Madonna
Bitch I'm Madonna

Who do you think you are?
You can't mess with this lucky star

Ooh, oh, oh ooh

Who do you think you are?

Hold up with my nose up
And that rose up in that thang up

I'm froze up, but my stove up
Cause he eatin' like this his dinner

I run shit, I don't fall back
Cause I'm on track, I'm a sprinter

I'm bossed up, I got em awestruck
It's not a toss up, I'm the winner

Beep beep, bitch move

'Fore I bang bang with that Uz
That's miu miu on my shoes
Ain't got a thing left for me to prove
It's that bottle service all night
It's that poppin' urban just right
It's that go hard or go home zone

Bitch, I'm Madonna, these hoes know

You're gonna love this
You can't touch this
Cause I'm a bad bitch
You're gonna love this
You can't touch this
Cause I'm a bad bitch

Who do you think you are?
Cause I'm a bad bitch
Who do you think you are?
Cause I'm a bad bitch
Who do you think you are?
